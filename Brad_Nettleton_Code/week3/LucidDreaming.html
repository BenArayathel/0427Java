    <p>One simple way to get started lucid dreaming is to ask yourself as often 
        as possible if you're dreaming or not. Doing this regularly throughout
        your waking life will eventually inspire you to ask this question while dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>Asking is typically not enough to know if you are dreaming or not. You're better
        than you might think at rationalizing your dreams as perfectly normal and not
        out of the ordinary at all. You must check. There are a few characteristics
        of dreams that you can take advantage of to test if you are awake or dreaming.
