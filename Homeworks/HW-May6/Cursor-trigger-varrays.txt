collection (varrays, record, index by table) in SQL?
A collection is an ordered group of elements having the same data type. Each element is identified by a unique subscript that represents its position in the collection.

varrays: Varrays (short for variable-size arrays) hold a fixed number of elements (although you can change the number of elements at runtime). They use sequential numbers as subscripts. You can define equivalent SQL types, allowing varrays to be stored in database tables.
record: A record is a data structure that can hold data items of different kinds. Records consist of different fields, similar to a row of a database table.
index by table: An index-by table (also called an associative array) is a set of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to locate the corresponding value. The key can be either an integer or a string.
