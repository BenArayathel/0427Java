			<!--  Connection Pool:
						A method of speeding up database calls. Hibernate will create 10 connection to the database when 
						it starts up. And everytime you create a session, the session will "borrow" an active connection
						from the connection pool. When you close a session the connection deosn't close, it is imply freed up for 
						another session to use. (By default the pool_size is 20) -->

			<!-- Settings for hbm2ddl.auto
				
				CREATE - drops all tables and objects (that have names asssociated with your annotations), hibernate will 
						create you schema from scratch (THIS IS NOT GREAT FRO PRODUCTION!!! Only use it for Dev purposes)
				VALIDATE - hibernate checks to make sure the schema exists as expected before operating
				UPDATE - will NOT delete anything, it'll only add or modify existing schema elements, so that schema works 
						with hibernat's schema. 
				NONE - it means hibernate won't do anything to your scehma automatically.
