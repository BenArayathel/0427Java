            The {{}} syntax is used for interpolation. Interpolation evaluates an expression. 
            You cna do simple operations like addition, or reference a variable from the TS file. 

            We're using interpolation to achieve one-way data binding. But it is not the same
            thig. There are many way one binding. 

            One-way binding (w/interpolation) projects values in TS to the HTML page to be displayed
            So any changes to the TS file will immediately affect the HTML, but not the other way 
            around.

                        The [()] syntax is used for 2-way binding. Also reffered to as 
                        "apple in a box". In two-way data binding HTML values and the TS values
                        are tied to each other. If one changes, the other immediately relfets 
                        those changes. 

                        To set up the two-way data binding you need ngModel that is a part of the 
                        "FormsModule" module.

                        A combination of one-way binding and event binding.
