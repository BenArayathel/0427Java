    AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

        Synchronous:
            Means "not blocked".
            Things happen independently from each other.
            Can make multiple requests at once w/o needing to wait for other resuts to complete.
            Makes websites more responsive.

        Synchronous:
            Means "blocked".
            Stops all other "threads".

        What actually is AJAX?
            Technique for accessing web servers from a webpage asynchronously.

        Consists of:
            Browser built-in XMLHttpRequest Object (requests data from web server).
            JavaScript
            HTML DOM (to manipulate page)

        Steps:
            1. An event occurs in a webpage; prepare that event to send
            2. An XMLHttpRequest obj is then created by JS.
            3. The XMLHttpRequest obj sends a request to a web server.
            4. Server processes the request.
            5. Server sends a response back to the web page.
            6. Response is read by JS.
            7. We do stuff with it (a proper action is performed by JS, e.g. info displayed).

    HTTP
        http methods: attached to http REQUESTS, similar to CRUD operations
            GET - retrieve a resource
            POST - create a resource (and other stuff)
            PUT - update a resource
            DELETE - delete a resource
            PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT, and even more..
        http statuses: attached to http RESPONSES
            100s - informational
            200s - success
            300s - redirect
            400s - client side errors
            500s - server side errors
