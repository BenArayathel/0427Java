General Stuff
	src - folder that contains human-readable code; .java
	bin - folder that contains binary (compiled files) that the JVM executes; .jar, .class

Recall:
	Everything within Main(), will go onto the stack for execution.
	Everything instance-level will go onto the heap.
    Method overloading is the same method name but different parameters.
    Method overriding is the same name but different implementation.

Wrapper Classes
    Wrap around primitive data types.
    Turns primitives into Objects:
        boolean > Boolean
        int > Integer
        char > Character
        byte > Byte
        short > Short
        long > Long
        double > Double
    Why?
        So we can call methods on the objects (can't call methods on primitives).
        To be used with data structures like the Collection API.
    Primitives are still faster than wrappers.
    Only use wrapper when a method needs to accept an Object.

String
	An object that contains an array of characters.
	Allows creation and manipulation of strings (notice lowercase).
	Immutable
        Strings can't be changed once initialized.
	Final
        The class cannot be extended.
    In memory:
        String objects are stored in heap; (Dog dog = new Dog())
        String literals are stored in String pool, which itself is within heap memory. (String s = "hello");

    StringBuilder
        Mutable, more efficient (faster) than StringBuffer.
    StringBuffer
        Also mutable, but also thread safe/synchronized.
        Lower efficiency (slower) than StringBuffer; it's gotta wait for other threads before continuing.

Collections Framework
    A combination of classes and interface which are used to store and manipulate data in the form of objects.
	Gives devs access to prepackaged data structures and algorithms for manipulating them.
	java.util.Collection is the root for all data structures
	All collections by default are iterable.
	Collections is a utility class (helper class) that contains methods like sort(), shuffle(), binarySearch(), reverse(), etc.
    Only OBJECTS can be stored in a collection.

    Hierarchy:
        Iterable(I) > Collection (I) > List(I)/Set(I)/Queue(I)
    List(I) - ordered collection of objects that can contain duplicates; allows random access of elements.
        ArrayList(C) - dynamic arrays that grow as needed.
        LinkedList(C) -
        Vector(C)
    Set(I) - unordered collection of objects that cannot contain duplicates.
    Queue(I) - FIFO that can contain duplicates.
    Deque(I) - double-ended queue; allows insertion/deletion from both ends.
    Map(I) - stores elements in key/value pairs; must contain a unique key but can have duplicates values.

    CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
        Arrays are slow; must iterate through entire array.
        Easier in collections, no need to iterate through.
    Dynamic and Resizeable - memory increase/decrease based on elements added/removed.

RegEx (Regular Expression)
	An expression commonly used across programming languages; minor syntax changes.
	PMA - Pattern Matching Algorithm
	[] - expression
	{} - length
	^ - not
	? -
	. -
	* -
	() -
	Examples:
		[a-z]{5} - "any lowercase letter of length 5"
		[0-9]{1,} - "at least 1 digit and max can be any"
		[a-zA-Z0-9]{10} = "any alphanumeric word of length 10"
		[^a-zA-Z0-9] - "apart from alphanumeric" (anything except alphanumeric)

Exceptions
	Exception: anything disrupting the flow of an application.
	Exception-handling determines the quality of an application.

	Separations of Concerns: Normal Workflow
	Client/Users/Apps >
		Tier 1: Presentation Layer
			Logic
			Accepts user input
		Tier 2: Business/Application Layer
			Logic
			Checks and validates user input
			Pre-filter, preliminary checks before consulting DB
		Tier 3: Persistance/DB Layer
			Logic
			Interacts with database
	> Database, SQL, NoSQL, PL/SQL

	Object >
		Throwable (all exceptions throwable) >
			Exception (Checked Exception) >
			- SQLException
			- ClassNotFoundException
			- ParseException
			- IOException
				RuntimeException (Unchecked Exceptions), compiler forces dev to handle it
				- ArithmeticException (DivideByZero)
				- IndexOutOfBoundsException
				- ConcurrentModificationException

	try..catch..finally
		try - suspected code that might throw an exception
		catch - handler of exception
		finally - last block; runs regardless of whether exception was handled or not
	throws
		Tosses exception back to previous layer
	throw
		Explicitly create an exception with my own message

	When an exception thrown at runtime, JVM creates exception Object with a predefined message.
		Then, it checks if the dev has handled it.

Serialization
	Serialization is the process of converting a Java Object into a byte stream,
	to transfer it from one JVM to another and recreate it via deserialization.

	For an object to be serializable:
		The parent class must implement the Serializable interface.
		All vars in class must be serializable; mark transient if you don't want it to be.

	When implementing Serializable, must generate a seriazable ID.

	ObjectOutStream used to serialize an object.
		FileOutputStream used for writing byte data to a File.
		For writing character streams, use FileWriter.

	ObjectInputStream used to deserialize an object.
		FileInputStream used for reading byte data from a File.
		For reading character streams, use FileReader.

	Why?
		To save/persist state of an object.
		To travel an object across a network.
		Serialized data streams support encryption compression, authentication, and secure Java computing.
		Many critical technologies rely on serialization.

Comparable vs Comparator (Sorting)
	Comparable
        Compares an object WITH ITSELF.
        Must first implement java.lang.Comparable interface.
        One method: .compareTo(Object obj);
        Returns:
            positive integer, if the current object is greater than the specified object.
            negative integer, if the current object is less than the specified object.
            zero, if the current object is equal to the specified object.
    Comparator
        Compares TWO OBJECTS.
        Must first implement java.util.Comparator interface.
        Two methods: .compare(Object obj1,Object obj2) and .equals(Object obj).

Design Patterns
    Language agnostic solutions to common problem scenarios.
    Allows for more reusable and maintainable code.
    Creational Design Patterns - resolves issues w/ creating objects in a system.
        Singleton Pattern: restricts instantiation to one object.
        Factory Pattern:
    Structural Design Patterns - focuses on how classes and objects can be composed.
        Identifies simplest way to realize relationships bt entities.
        Adapter:
    Behavioral Design Patterns - deals with how objects interact (communicate).
        Chain of Responsibility:

Multithreading
    Thread: a single process of execution; shares resources within the core its in.
    Multithreading: running multiple threads in parallel.

    Main Thread
        Child threads will spawn from it.
        Will be the last thread to finish execution; once it stops, the program stops.
    Daemon Thread
        Thread always running in the background.
        E.g., Garbage Collection
    User Threads
        Can be started and closed manually by user.

    Two ways to make custom threads:
        1. Implementing Runnable interface
            Can even extend another class while also implementing runnable.
            Also has less overhead, you don't get unnecessary methods.
        2. Extending Thread class
            Less lines of code to "start".
            Easier to override functionality of the Thread class.

    States of a Threads = New > Runnable > Running > Waiting > Dead
        New: the thread is instantiated.
        Runnable: start() has been invoked, but the schedular hasn't selected it to start running.
        Running: scheduler has selected it to run.
        Waiting, Time Waiting, Blocked: the thread is alive, but not currently running.
        Dead: thread has been terminated.

    Common Thread Problems
        1. Synchronization
            When threads are utilizing the same resource, e.g. modifying a data structure,
            errors will occur bc changes will occur to the resource in separate threads.
        2. Deadlock
            When multiple threads are trying to access the same resource.
        3. Producer-Consumer
            Producer produces resources for another thread, via storing it in a buffer.
            Consumer consumes resource and removes it from the buffer.
            Error occurs if:
                Producer continually produces and consumer never consumes.
                Consumer tries to consume but there's nothing in the buffer to consume.

Maven
    Maven is a dependency manager; allows integration of external libraries and packages.
    Also considered a built and automation tool.

    Dependency: external standalone program that we'll utilize in our project.
    POM: Project Object Model, formatted as an XML file containing all config details for Maven project.

SQL
    Important Commands:
        SELECT - extracts data from a database
        UPDATE - updates records in a table
            // Updates (SET) based on condition (WHERE)
            UPDATE table_name
            SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
            WHERE condition;
        DELETE - deletes records in a table
            DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
        INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database; two methods:
            // Add values individually per column
            INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
            VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

            // Add values to all columns; make sure addition order is in same order as columns, though.
            INSERT INTO table_name
            VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
        ORDER BY ASC/DESC - sorts in ascending order
            // Sorts alphabetically by country, then reverse-alphabetically by name
            ORDER BY Country ASC, Name DESC;
        CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
        ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
        CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
        ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
        DROP TABLE - deletes a table
        CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
        DROP INDEX - deletes an index

    Test for NULL values using IS NULL or IS NOT NULL; cannot use operators like = or !=.
