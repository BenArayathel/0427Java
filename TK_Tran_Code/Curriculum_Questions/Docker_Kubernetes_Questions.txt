What are 6 REST constraints? client-server, stateless, cacheable, uniform interface, layered system, code on demand (optional).
What annotations should you replace @Controller with to implement RESTful web services using Spring? @RestController (@Controller and @ResponseBody)
What is marshalling? What is unmarshalling? transforming the memory representation of an obj to a data format suitable for storage or transmission.
What object in Spring can be used to send an HTTP response? @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc..
How can we send a status code back to client side (Inside of our controller)? @ResponseStatus above the method.
What is an annotation that can be used to implement custom exception handling for ResponseEntity objects? @ExceptionHandler above the method.

What is SOAP? Simple Object Access Protocol, an XML-based messaging protocol.
What is WSDL? Web Services Description Language, an XML-based language for describing the functionality offered by a web service.
What are some of the properties that the WSDL contains? <definition>, <types>, <message>, <porttype>, <operations>, <binding>, <service>, <port>.
What are the 4 types of WSDL bindings? Which one is not used? DOCUMENT/literal, DOCUMENT/encoded, RPC/literal, RPC/encoded.
Difference between Contract-First and Contract-Last approach for SOAP services?
What is a SOAP message? the message to be sent.
Explain WSDL tags which you know. <definition>, <types>, <message>, <porttype>, <operations>, <binding>, <service>, <port>.
SOAP Vs REST: "TECMAPS": tools used, exception handling, contract, message, atomicity, protocol, security.

Explain the importance of Circuit Breaker Hystrix?
Explain Hystrix Dashboard. Allows you to monitor Hystrix metrics in realtime. 
What is the use of Message Queues? (Apache kafka or Rabbit MQ)
List down the annotations used with Netflix OSS with Spring Cloud for the different Infrastructure services available.

What is Virtualization? Creating a virtual version of something, including hardware or network resources.
What is HyperV? Microsoft's hypervisor; creates virtual machines.
What is Containerization? Bundling an app together with all its related config files, libraries and dependencies.
Why containerization is important for MSA? It allows for complete isolation of services from its host.
What is a Virtual Machine? A virtualization of computer hardware, each with its own OS and resources.
Compare docker swarms with kubernetes. Docker Swarm works well with smaller apps; Kubernetes allows scalability for very large apps.

Kuberenetes
What is a pod? A group of one or more containers with shared storage/network.
What is a node? Anything with processing power; may be a virtual or physical machine.
What is a cluster? A group of one or more nodes sharing resources. 
What is a persistant volume? A cluster-wide resource used to store data in a way that it persists beyond the lifetime of a pod.
What is kubernete deployments? Generated by Kubernetes and runs multiple replicas of your app and automatically replaces instances that fail.
What is kubernetes manifest? A YAML file used to create, modify and delete Kubernetes resources such as pods or deployments.
What is kubectl? CLI used to run Kubernetes commands.
What is ochestration with kubernetes? What is the advantages of using an ochestration tool? Automates app deployment, scaling, and management b/c too many containers.
What is the kubectl command line syntax template? 
What are types of resources you can use in kubernetes? (kubectl)
What are some basic operations you can use in kubernetes? (kubectl)
What kind of file can the kubernetes manifest be? YAML
