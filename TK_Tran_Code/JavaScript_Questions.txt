--[ JavaScript Questions ]--

What is the DOM?
	Document Object Model; created by browser when a webpage is loaded; constructed as a tree of objects.
	DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
		"The W3C DOM is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to 
		dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
	With the object model, JS can create dynamic HTML:
		JS can change all HTML elements and attributes in the page.
		JS can change all CSS styles in the page.
		JS can remove existing HTML elements and attributes.
		JS can add new HTML elements and attributes.
		JS can react to all existing HTML events in the page.
		JS can create new HTML events in the page.

What are some advantages that can be gained through using JavaScript?
	Client-side language, easy to learn, comparatively fast for end-users.
	Versatility, popularity, simplicity.
What does it mean that JavaScript is loosely typed?
	Doesn't require a variable type to be defined on creation.
What does it mean that JavaScript is an interpreted language?
	Where implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling into machine language.
What tag would you use to wrap around a block of JavaScript on an HTML document and where would you need to place it?
	<script></script> can be placed in head or the last block in the HTML <body> tags.
Is JavaScript case sensitive?

What are three different ways you can create variables in JavaScript and when would you use each?
	var - can be globally OR function/locally scoped.
		Can be updated AND redeclared.
	let - only block-scoped (anything within {} is a block).
		Can be updated but NOT redeclared.
	const - maintains constant values.
		Cannot be updated or redeclared.
What are global variables? How are these variable declared and what are the problems associated with using them?
	Variables that can be accessed globally; issues with unintentional overwriting of global variables.
What JavaScript values are considered falsey? What are considered truthy?
	Seemingly different values equate to TRUE when compared with == (loosely equals).
	But FALSE occurs when compared with === (strictly equals) because type is considered.
What are undeclared and undefined variables?
	Undeclared - variable declared WITHOUT "var" keyword.
	Undefined - variable declared but NO VALUES EXIST.
What is === operator?
	Compares data type and value.
What is the typeof operator?
	Returns the data type of the given thing.
What is hoisting in JavaScript?
	A mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution.
	Example: this
		console.log(greeter);
		var greeter = "say hello";
	Example: is interpreted as this
		var greeter;
		console.log(greeter); // greeter is undefined
		greeter = "say hello";
	So variables are hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with a value of undefined.
What are anonymous functions?
	One declared without a name, often not accessible after its initial creation.
	Example:
		let show = function () {
			console.log("Anonymous function);
		}

		show();
	Because we need to call the function later, we assign it to the show variable.
	Example: using arrow functions
		let add = (a, b)  => a + b;
		Equivalent to:
		let function add(a, b) {
			return a + b;
		}
What is an IIFE?
	Immediately Invoked Function Expressions; a func that runs as soon as its defined.
	Example:
		(function () {
			// statements
		})();
How can you add new elements dynamically?
	With the HTML DOM createElement() method.
	Example:
		var btn = document.createElement("BUTTON"); 	// creates a <button> element
		btn.innerHTML = "CLICK ME"; 					// inserts text
		document.body.appendChild(btn);					// append <button> to <body>
