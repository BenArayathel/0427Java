Wrapper Classes wrap around primitive data types.
Turns primitives into Objects:
	boolean > Boolean
	int > Integer
	char > Character
	byte > Byte
	short > Short
	long > Long
	double > Double
Why?
	Objects have methods assocaited with them.
	Data structures like the Collection API.

Primitives are still faster than wrappers.
Only use wrapper when a method needs to accept an Object.
Recall:
	Everything within Main(), will go onto the stack for execution.
	Everything instance-level will go onto the heap.

String
	An object that contains an array of characters.
	Allows creation and manipulation of strings (notice lowercase).
	Immutable: Strings can't be changed.
	Final: The class cannot be extended.
	String objects are stored on heap, but String Literals are stored in String pool, 
		which itself is within heap memory.

StringBuilder
	Mutable, more efficient than StringBuffer.

StringBuffer
	Mutable, thread safe/synchronized.
	Lower efficiency than StringBuffer.
