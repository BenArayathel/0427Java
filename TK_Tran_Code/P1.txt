# Project 1 Requirements
    Project-1(P1) is the transformation from P0 to P1.
    
    You must convert the console-based app of P0 to a web-based app
    
    Frontend technologies(HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Vanilla JS) – client side validations using vanilla JS is a must, 
        no Angular strictly, any other JS framework you guys wish use please debate the need of it with us and 
        after approval you can go ahead and use it.
    
    Server Side technology – the BO(service) and DAO layer will be still the same, you will be using SERVLETS(from JEE) to 
        handle SERVER-SIDE SCRIPTING to HANDSHAKE WITH JS; when JS does a AJAX call, the servlet will be able to read the 
        incoming request and generate back the responses as JSON and JS will process it and put it to client.
    
    Do not waste much time in building a clean UI and in beautifying the client side, rather the focus should be on making the 
        handshakes from frontend to backend and bringing out the efficiency by doing bug fixes, separation of concerns, usage of 
        technical aspects. We are totally good accepting a Simple UI with rich functionality, so please focus on it.
    
    Evaluation parameters will be as the same as P0.
