Project 1
    • Project-1(P1) is the transformation from P0 to P1.
    • You must convert the console-based app of P0 to the web-based app
    • UI side technologies(Html, css, Bootstrap, vanilla JS) – client side
      validations using vanilla JS is must and should, no angular strictly,
      any other JS framework you guys wish to use please debate the need of
      it with us and after approval you can go ahead and use it.
    • Server Side technology – the BO(service) and DAO layer will be still
      the same you will be using Servlets(from JEE) to handle server side
      scripting to do handshake with JS, when JS does a AJAX call, the servlet
      will be able to read the incoming request and generate back the responses
      as JSON and JS will process it and put it to client.
    • Do not waste much time in building a clean UI and in beautifying the client
      side, rather the focus should be on making the handshakes from frontend to
      backend and bringing out the efficiency by doing bug fixes, separation of
      concerns, usage of technical aspects. We are totally good accepting a Simple
      UI with rich functionality, so please focus on it.
    • Evaluation parameters will be as the same as P0.
