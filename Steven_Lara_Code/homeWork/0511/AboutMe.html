        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I have been learning computer languages and computers in general for about 3 years now. I do lack professional experience but nonetheless 
            I do have college credits from my undergraduate career. Cool fact I pursued an Economics degree, and like you can imagine those computer
            credits did not help me graduate. I just took them because they were intriguing and fun.
