Web service?

	Basically, a service that is offered over the web. Can include any type of software, application or cloud technologies. Utilises web protocol (HTTP)
	using data formats (JSON, xml, etx..).

	Why not send over service via a jar file?
		Platform dependence:
			Waht do fo, if I have c#?
			What to do, if i hvave Postgressql?
		Update anomalies?
			I'll have to find the new version or I'll be stuck with the oudated version. 
		Service the data will require DB access
			Nobody want to send their DB credentials..

	Essential Aspects of a web service?
		Available over the internet (or intranet networks)
		Support client-serve communication 
		Platform independent
		Self-describing 
		Discoverable 

	2 Common types of Web Services:
		REST - REpresentational State Transfer
		SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol 

	SOA (Service Oriented Architecture):
		Technique for building applications using loosely coupled services. 

	Benefits of SOA:
		Modular Business Services
		Code Reuse 
		Scalability 
		Language Independent 


	HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 
		1)Stateless protocol 
		2)Application layer protocol (sitting on top of the transport layer, TCP most of the time)
		3)
			HTTP request 
				Request Line:
					URI - Uniform Resource Identifier 
					Method
					HTTP version number - shows which HTTP spec to which the client has tried to comply to 
				Header:
					Allows you to send additional information with your request or response. Accept-Language: eng, fr,
					Authentication, Caching. 
				Body:
					Message body, the entity is the actual content of the message. It's in text and can take any data format. 

			HTTP Response:
				Status Line:
					Status code: 3 digit number notifying us about the result of our request 
					HTTP version number
					Reason phrase - (status text) human readable text that summarises the meaning of the status code
				Http Headers:
					Same as Http request 
				Http Body:
					Same as Http request
Methods:
	GET: Retrieve a resource
	POST: Create a resource 
	PUT: Updating an existing resource (replaces the entire object with a new object)
	DELETE: Delete an existing resource
	PATCH: Is a partial update (overwrite ONLY the field it needs to )
	OPTIONS - returns available functionalities (operations the server can take)
	HEAD - similar to a GET, except it does not return a body 
	TRACE...
	CONNECT...

	Safe method?
		Does not change the state of your application 

	Idempotent method?
		An idempotent method will have the same outcome, regardless of how many times it is performed

			Safe			Idempotent
	GET		yes			yes
	POST		no			no
	PUT		no			yes
	DELETE 		no			yes
	PATCH		no			no
	OPTION		yes			yes
	HEAD		yes			yes
