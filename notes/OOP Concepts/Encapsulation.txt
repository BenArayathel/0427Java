Encapsulation:

	Is the practice of restricting access to resources within your 
	class or object. This is to ensure data isn't accessible 
	without the approptiate permissions. 

	Java implements this via access modifier keywords:
	In order of least secure to most secure:
	
	public :
		This resource is accessible to any system 

	protected: 
		This resource is only available to classes or objects 
		within the same package as the resource or if it is a
		child class.
	
	default (implicit):
		This resource is only available to classes or objects 
		within the same package.

	private:
		Only available to the class, no other systems.
