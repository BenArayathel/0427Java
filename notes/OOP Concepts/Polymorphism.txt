Polymorphism:

	The word itself means to take many different forms. From inheritance 
	we're allowed to reuse code implemented by parent classes but we can 
	also use those methods to complete different actions.

	Overriding:
		Using the same method signature of the parent class but with 
		a different implementation. 

		Run time polymorphism (dynamic binding)
	
		Only applicable to inherited methods, so Constructors and 
		same level methods cannot be overriden

	Overloading
		Same method name, but different parameters:
			Different number of parameters
			Different types of parameters
			Different order to parameters

		Compile time polymorphism (static binding)

		Can be applied to constructors and same level methods, they 
		can also have different return types as well.
