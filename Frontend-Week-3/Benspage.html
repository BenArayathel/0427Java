	<h2 class="headline">About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Ben Knaak.  I've been a law student, programmer, and briefly a sysadmin.  I've been a wrestling fan for a while, then not been one for a while, then became one again.  I have a dog who loves me because I smell like his human.

		<h2 class ="headline">Hobbies</h2>
		<p>I like tabletop and online roleplaying games, the Elder Scrolls, medieval history, kung-fu movies, fighting games, and professional wrestling.  Pretty much any old junk with fake fighting in it will do it for me.  That's my trash.

		<h2 class = "headline">Interesting Topic</h2>
		<p>I'm something of a history buff, and one particular country's history that has always fascinated me is Ethiopia.  Civilization flourished in Ethiopia long before it ever did in Europe.  Legend has it that the first King of Axum was the illegitimate son of King Solomon by the Queen of Sheba.  Saint George's Church in Axum claims that he brought the Ark of the Covenant with him, and that it now rests within the church's walls.  Yet the country in its modern form arguably dates no earlier than the 19th century, when the Emperors Tewodros, Yohannes, and Menelik brought the country to its current extent.  They preserved their country's independence, but along with economic and political change came ethnic strife.  Many books have been written about the history of this country, and I've read an awful lot of them.  It's a shame that so little is taught about Africa in American schools.
